Thanks for visiting my portfolio! Below you'll find a list of details on how this portfolio was built, as well as how each of the projects inside were made. Over the course of approximately 6 months, I quickly learned to go from building very simple sites like the quiz app, to full-stack websites using a modern front-end framework. I learned before and after a full time job each day.

This site was built using HTML5, CSS3, and just a touch of vanilla Javascript.

Here are some quick facts about this site:

1. Fully-responsive (e.g. mobile and desktop friendly)
2. Minified files for quick load times
3. Modern CSS tooling including:
    * Flexbox
    * CSS Grid
4. CSS Animations on buttons and header text
5. Google Analytics included
6. Optimized using Lighthouse, a part of Google Dev Tools
    * Improved SEO
    * Fixed accessibility issues
    * Increased page load speed - 98/100 on [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
